/*
Hackerrank Question 13:-
---Classes and Objects---
Create a class named Student with the following specifications:

An instance variable named scores to hold a student's 5 exam scores.
A void input() function that reads 5 integers and saves them to scores.
An int calculateTotalScore() function that returns the sum of the student's scores.
Input Format

Most of the input is handled for you by the locked code in the editor.

In the void Student::input() function, you must read 5 scores from stdin and save them to your scores instance variable.
